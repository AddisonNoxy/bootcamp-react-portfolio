                <p>
                    My name is Nick Papazafiropoulos, and I'm a student in the UNC full stack web development bootcamp. For most of my life I grew up in Kansas, only recently moving to North Carolina in the past few years. I'm glad that I took the opportunity, as otherwise I wouldn't have found out about this bootcamp.

                    I'm a person with a passion for reading, writing, and programming. My focus has primarily been on video game development, and ultimately I hope to someday pursue a career in that field.
